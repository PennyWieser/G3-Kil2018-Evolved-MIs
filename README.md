# G3-Kil2018-Evolved-MIs
This repository contains analytical data and example MELTS for MATLAB models for the G3 paper "Explosive activity on Kīlauea’s Lower East Rift Zone fuelled by a volatile-rich, dacitic melt"

All MELTS for Matlab models were run in Version 1.0

Dacite_Ascent_Example_RealComp.m - Tracking volatiles and major elements during ascent of the dacitic magma
Basalt_Ascent_Example_RealComp.m - Tracking volatiles and major elements during ascent of the BA magma
Viscosity_Calcs.xlsx - Outputs from Matlab for ascent to load into ipynb notebook
Viscosity_calculations.ipynb - Viscosity calculations using Thermobar
Volatile_Evolution_Fractionation_ModelB.m - Tracking volatiles during fractional crystallization from basalt to dacite
Dataset_S1.xlsx - Includes melt inclusion and matrix glass trace and major element data, and MELTS model outputs
Dataset_S2.xlsx - Secondary standard information for LAICPMS and EPMA
Dataset_S3.pdf - Pictures of all melt inclusions analysed in this study
